Simple FET carrier primarily for adapting BM800 mics.

The Neewer BM800 is a popular Chinese microphone that comes with a Schopes-like balanced (but single output!) circuit. This replaces that board with a simple JFET and a couple of small capactitors to reduce RFI so it can be connetected to a much better quality pre-amp/digitiser like the one designed Matthew Perks for his original DIY Perks Ultimate USB-C microphone and the later designs incluing Michelle 4.0 found here. It's deliberately simple but can take quality, high-gain JFETS like the 2N4116 as used in Matt's original or many others including SMD at your option.
